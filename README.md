## 🚧 **Currently Under Construction** 🚧

SysBridge is an ambitious project aimed at creating seamless transformation pathways between SysML v1 and SysML v2 models. While we're hard at work building this bridge, please note that **this tool is still in active development**.

## What is SysBridge?

SysBridge is a transformation tool designed to help systems engineers navigate the evolution from SysML v1 to SysML v2. As the systems modeling landscape shifts toward the more powerful and expressive SysML v2 specification, many organizations find themselves with valuable SysML v1 models that need to be preserved, understood, and potentially migrated.

Think of SysBridge as your trusted guide across the modeling chasm - helping you carry forward your modeling investments while embracing the future of systems engineering.

## 🎯 Vision & Goals

- **Seamless Migration**: Transform SysML v1 models to SysML v2 with minimal data loss
- **Intelligent Mapping**: Smart semantic mapping between different modeling paradigms
- **Validation & Verification**: Ensure transformed models maintain their intended meaning

## 🚀 Planned Features

### Phase 1: Foundation (🔨 Current Focus)
- [ ] SysML v1 model parsing and analysis
- [ ] Basic structural element identification
- [ ] Core transformation engine architecture
- [ ] SysML v2 output generation framework

### Phase 2: Smart Transformations
- [ ] Block diagram to part/item mappings
- [ ] Parametric model conversions

### Phase 3: Production Ready
- [ ] RESTful API
- [ ] CI/CD integration
- [ ] Comprehensive reporting
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🛠 Current Status

**What's Working:**
- Project structure and development environment
- Initial research and specification analysis
- Proof-of-concept parsing capabilities

**What's Coming Next:**
- Core transformation engine implementation
- Basic SysML v1 element recognition
- Initial SysML v2 output generation

## 🤝 Contributing

We're actively seeking contributors who are passionate about systems modeling! Whether you're a SysML expert, a transformation engine wizard, or someone who just wants to help build the future of systems engineering tools.

### How to Help:
- **Massive data**: Share your SysML v1 models (anonymized) and corresponding SysML v2 syntax for training
